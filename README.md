We envision an application that overcomes the manual challan method of our traffic system. We will digitize challan and tickets. The purpose of digitalization is to enable automation, increase data quality and structure, easy and immediate access, and integration. We want to create ease for users as well as for Traffic Administration. Our aim is to provide a perfect solution for the current challenges which the traffic departments are facing with respect to issuance of traffic challans, managing records, paying and tracking them etc.
